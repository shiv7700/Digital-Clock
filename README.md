# Digital Clock

A digital clock in JavaScript involves using the Date object to obtain the current time and updating the displayed time in a designated HTML element at regular intervals. The HTML structure provides the space for displaying the time, and the JavaScript code handles the logic of retrieving and formatting the time. Styling, while optional, can enhance the visual presentation of the digital clock.
